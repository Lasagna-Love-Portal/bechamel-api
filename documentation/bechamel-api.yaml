    Proposed API - REST API calls and data objects - for the Bechamel API.

    
    The Bechamel API is used by web and mobile clients to support volunteers, requesters and admininstrators

          items:
            type: string
          description: |
            Array of profile types this user has. Typically this will be one type, either to denote a requester
            or a volunteer chef. This will contain multiple types for local leaders, regional directors and other admininstrators;
            and for users who started out as one type of user (a requester or volunteer) but who subsequently has taken on
            a different role.

            Valid profile type strings -
            * "requester" - denotes a user who is a requester to Lasagna Love for meals or other types or requests.
            * "recipient" - denotes a user who is the intended recipient for a Lasagna Love request. Many users will be both a requester and recipient.
              However, Lasagna Love does let people make requests (nominations) for others, so some users will only be requesters or recipients.
            * "chef" - denotes a user who is volunteer chef for Lasagna Love.
              **Note**: this is intentionally not a general 'volunteer' designation to allow for future differentiation of types of volunteers,
                e.g. volunteers who are willing to provide meals vs. volunteers who are interested in other types of opportunities.
            * "leader" - denotes a user who is a local leader for Lasagna Love. Local leaders coordinate volunteers and requests
              for a given Lasagna Love service area.
            * "director" - denotes a user who is a regional director for Lasagna Love. Regional directors coordinate the volunteers,
              requests and local leaders for multiple Lasagna Love service areas in a region.
            * "admin" - denotes a user who is a Lasagna Love system admininstrator.
            * "superadmin" - denotes a user who is a Lasagna Love system super admininstrator.
            * "service" - denotes a service account. This is a special user type for internal system operations.

          type: string
          description: Email address for this user. This email address will be the address used to communicate with the user,
            to send password reset requests to, and for other Lasagna Love purposes.

        emailValidated:
          type: boolean
          description: true if the user's email address was successfully validated by the Lasagna Love system, false if not.
            Profiles with unvalidated email addresses should not be involved in request matching and are not eligible to have their requests fulfilled.


            Typically, the Lasagana Love system will update this value for a user's profile when email address validation is successful.
            Users should not be allowed to set this to true interactively. However, a caller should set this to false when a new email address
            is provided by a user for their profile.

            For Australia and Canada based volunteers, this is expressed in kilometers from their address to the recipient.
            ** NOTE: travel distance is calculated differently based on different regions.** Most regions calculate using
              "as the crow flies" distance. Certain regions use actual driving distance as calcuated by a 3rd party map API.

              * the first part is an ISO 8601 format date string specifying the first day of the availability period
              * the second part is an ISO 8601 format date string specifying the last day, inclusive, of the availability period
              * the third part is a non-negative integer specifying the number of requests that may be fulfilled.
                This may be 0 to indicate no availability though this is not recommended.
                Large requests, for example meal requests for large parties, may be considered as multiple requests by the matching system.

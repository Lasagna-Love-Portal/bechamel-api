    Proposed API - REST API calls and data objects - for the Bechamel API.


    The Bechamel API is used by web and mobile clients to support volunteers, requesters and admininstrators
    in the Lasagna Love system.


    The API described here is a **PROPOSAL** and is **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**.

        roles:
          type: array
          description: |
            Array of profile types this user has. Typically this will be one role, either to denote a requester
            or a volunteer chef. This will contain multiple roles for local leaders, regional directors
            and other admininstrators;
            and for users who started out as one role (a requester or volunteer) but who subsequently has taken on
            a different additional role.

            Valid profile role strings -
            * "requester" - denotes a user who is a requester to Lasagna Love for meals or other types or requests.
            * "recipient" - denotes a user who is the intended recipient for a Lasagna Love request.
              Many users will be both a requester and recipient.
              However, Lasagna Love does let people make requests (nominations) for others,
              so some users will only be requesters or recipients.
            * "chef" - denotes a user who is volunteer chef for Lasagna Love.
              **Note**: this is intentionally not a general 'volunteer' designation to allow for future differentiation
                of types of volunteers, e.g. volunteers who are willing to provide meals vs. volunteers
                who are interested in other types of opportunities.
            * "leader" - denotes a user who is a local leader for Lasagna Love. Local leaders coordinate volunteers
              and requests for a given Lasagna Love service area.
            * "director" - denotes a user who is a regional director for Lasagna Love. Regional directors coordinate
              the volunteers, requests and local leaders for multiple Lasagna Love service areas in a region.
            * "admin" - denotes a user who is a Lasagna Love system admininstrator.
            * "superadmin" - denotes a user who is a Lasagna Love system super admininstrator.

            A blank string is returned when retrieving a user profile instead of the user's password.

        email_validated:
          type: boolean
          description: true if the user's email address was successfully validated by the Lasagna Love system,
            false if not. Profiles with unvalidated email addresses should not be involved in request matching
            and are not eligible to have their requests fulfilled.


            Typically, the Lasagana Love system will update this value for a user's profile when email address validation
            is successful. Users should not be allowed to set this to true interactively.
            However, a caller should set this to false when a new email address is provided by a user for their profile.

      summary: Updates the current user's specified profile fields with the values specified in the provided JSON body
      description: |
        Updates the profile for the user specified by the provided JWT token, changing every specified field
        in the provided JSON body to the value provided.

        For embedded JSON objects, only the fields to update in those objects should be specified.

        *Example:* once a user watches the food safety training video, their profile can be updated to reflect this by
          providing the updated volunteer_info.attestations.volunteer_completed_safety_training field and value only.

        Do **NOT** specify null or empty values unless intending to remove the value for a field.

        **If you change the user's email address with this method, the user's access and refresh tokens
          will no longer be valid. The /login API will need to be called with the new email address
          to generate new access and refresh tokens.**

        **id, creation_time and last_update_time values cannot be changed.
          A request specifying one of these fields will be rejected.**
